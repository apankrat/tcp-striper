That is - to splice a pair of intermediate proxies into a TCP
connection and then have them talk via multiple TCP streams in 
parallel.


In particular, if an active stream between the proxies gets
congested, they would switch to another non-congested stream.
This should help proxies push more traffic through if/when
there are per-stream caps on the route between A and B. Like
the ones my cable provider has :)

  Re-organized the code as follows:

    /core - basic type imports, macros, assert() and logging
    /data - data containers (list and unbalanced map for now)
    /evl  - event loop (select-based for now)
    /io   - IO pipes & Co. - that's where the magic is
    /sys  - the platform glue (socket interface, termio, etc)

  The bestest part is in the /io. The io_pipe interface is a
  stateful IO abstraction based on TCP, but also allowing 
  extension of the send/recv behavior. For example, a pipe 
  of certain type can provide datagram framing, another type
  - SSL encryption, third - atomic send() behavior, etc. So
  you could attach these pipes one to another and get a 
  a reliable encrypted datagram-based connection.
  
  Moreover, it becomes possible to write a generalized bridge
  between any two pipes, which reads from one, writes to 
  another, minds the congestion and properly handles passing
  of the FINs between the peers. That's io_bridge.

  This is what tcp-striper does at the moment - it's a simple
  TCP proxy that accepts a connection on 0.0.0.0:55555, opens
  another one to 127.0.0.1:22 and then just bridges them 
  together. In other words, it's a TCP relay.

  The next step would be to add a special pipe type that
  maintains 2+ connections towards the peer and then stripes
  all data passed to it via send() between these connections.
  On the peer's end there'll be a complimentary pipe that
  would reverse the striping, re-assemble the data into a
  single stream and pass it to the app's io_bridge for 
  relaying out.

  Easy-peasy.
