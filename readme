That is - to splice a pair of intermediate proxies into a TCP
connection and then have them talk via multiple TCP streams in 
parallel.


In particular, if an active stream between the proxies gets
congested, they would switch to another non-congested stream.
This should help proxies push more traffic through if/when
there are per-stream caps on the route between A and B. Like
the ones my cable provider has :)



                         --  STATUS  --


28/08/14

  * Initial public offering (via github upload)

27/08/14

  * Simple TCP proxy with tracking of per-leg congestion
    (proxy_types.*)

26/08/14

  * Select-based event loop
    (event_loop/*)

25/08/14

  * Abstracted socket API (glue/*/socket.h)
  * Basic data containers (map is unbalanced!)
  * Basic app scaffolding (asserts, types, macros)
  * Makefile



                         --  TO PLAY  --

Build it first -

  cd src
  make

Launch it -

  ./tcp-striper

This will start a proxy on port 55555 that forwards to 
127.0.0.1:22, i.e. the SSH port. So doing this -

  ssh -p 55555 127.0.0.1 

should get you the prompt from the actual sshd. Then, hit
Ctrl-C in tcp-striper console and it will dump the summary
of its status. Something like this -

  -- proxy state --
  listening  : 0.0.0.0:55555
    backlog  : 8
  connecting : 127.0.0.1:22
  c2p buffer : 1024
  p2s buffer : 1024
  max read   : 1048576 /cycle
  ---- bridges ----
  0x98af5e8  : [c2p  -W-  fin:--] [p2s  -W-  fin:--]
  -----------------

For extra points try scp'ing a large file from a remote host 
to 55555 to see how the bridge responds to stream congestion.
  
To shutdown tcp-striper, hit Ctrl-C *twice* back to back.
